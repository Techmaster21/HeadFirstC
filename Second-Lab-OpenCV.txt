Tutorials regarding OpenCV for C are sparse. The links provided in the books no 
longer work as of writing(08/14/14) presumably because Willow Garage has shut 
down. 
Documentation on the functions provided by OpenCV can be found here: 
docs.opencv.org
And I also found this to be useful:
www.cs.iit.edu/~agam/cs512/lect-notes/opencv-intro/opencv-intro.html

At the least you will need to #include <opencv/cv.h> and <opencv/highgui.h>
and requisite compilation flags can be provided by 
pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv

Using the Farneback function suggested, I was unable to produce any meaningful 
output, but perhaps you will have more luck.
If not, I would look at blog.cedric.wx/opencv-simple-motion-detection
I did not personally attempt to use this method, but it seems simpler and more 
promising, though you will likely have to convert the functions from C++ API to 
C API (If that is even possible)
