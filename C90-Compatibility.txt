Also known as ANSI C. This file will list all programs(Not including those which 
aren't supposed to compile of course) which do not strictly conform(They may or 
may not compile) to ANSI C89/90 commonly known simply as ANSI C.

---Chapter1
--page8
--page20
--page28
--page37
-Do not strictly conform due to mixed variable declarations and code. Simple 
-fix is to simply move int val = 0; to the beginning of the function.
---Chapter2
-Some issues with %p technically expecting a void *, explained in source of the 
-first time the issue occurs, but that isn't really C90 specific.
---Chapter3
--page144-145/categorize.c
-Mixed declarations with code. Just move the FILE declarations to the beginning 
-of the function.
--page152-153
-Compiling with standard c90 causes an error because it doesn't include the gnu 
-extensions which allow POSIX macros to be defined in features.h and which in 
-turn allow unistd.h to include getopt.h. To fix this, either compile with 
- -std=gnu90 which is C90 with GNU extensions or #include <getopt.h> manually.
