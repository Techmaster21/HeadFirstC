Mac OSX Mavericks(maybe others) seems to have issues properly running geo2json, 
picking up carriage returns where there should be none. The original Mac OS used 
carriage returns instead of new lines, but for the same purpose as 
newlines(According to my research). However, these appear to be acting as 
carriage return should: returning to the beginning of the line without moving 
down. The result is madness. Fix unknown. Problem does not seem to reside in 
spooky.csv. Recommend full test on Mac OSX and Windows(Maybe even another, more 
common Linux distro(like Ubuntu)), and of course, discovering how to fix without 
jeopardizing other OS or making the user change the code for OS.


The issue was related to you copying the files from a windows machine. When you 
got it straight from github, there were no issues. Still recommend full test on 
all three OS when finished.
