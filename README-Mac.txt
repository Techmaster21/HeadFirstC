Even though Mac OS X is at its very base, Unix, and with Xcode installed, gcc 
works very well, you may still run into problems. If you do, I recommend running 
Ubuntu, Lubuntu(If you need something lighter/faster), or a Linux distribution 
of your choice inside a virtual machine.
Or, if your machine can't handle that, simply run it from a livecd(Won't save) 
or look into installing it alongside OS X.
