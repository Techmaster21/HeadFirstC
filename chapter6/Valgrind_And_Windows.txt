NOTE: Everything here is BY THE TIME OF WRITING. There may be a valgrind version 
for Windows by the time you read this (Hello from the past!), however that is 
fairly unlikely as the valgrind crew have stated it would be too much work to do 
so.

Valgrind does not provide any version that works on windows. However, there are 
of course, a couple of options.

The simplest and recommended:
Run an Ubuntu virtual machine using Virtualbox and type this into the terminal:
sudo apt-get install valgrind
If you are using another Linux distro, look at its documentation to discover how 
to work its package manager.

The long and convoluted and possibly outdated by the time you read this way:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/valgrind4win/
