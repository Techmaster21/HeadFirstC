As of writing(August 5th, 2014) Valgrind does not support newer versions of Mac
OS X. As I've said, this may be outdated by the time you read this so ALWAYS
check http://valgrind.org first.
There is an experimental valgrind version which instructions to install and use
can be found here:

As always though, the TIMELESS solution is a Linux Virtual Machine.
