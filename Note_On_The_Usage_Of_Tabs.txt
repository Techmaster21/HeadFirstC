I (Adrian Bolt aka Techmaster21, the one who took it upon himself to fix these 
source code samples) use tabs to indent code. The author of this book seems to 
use spaces. It is mostly a matter of personal preference. I do use spaces for 
alignment however, and doing so is necessary to ensure your code does not become 
unreadable on a machine that uses a different tab size than yours. I will 
demonstrate.

int main()
{
	printf("Foo %s",
	        bar);
}
Notice that I indented the line "bar);" with one tab, then used spaces to align 
it. This is imperative. If you use more tabs than is required to align it with 
the line it is a part of, your code will become unreadable on a system with a 
different tab size.
