This contains all source code for the book "Head First C" by David and Dawn Griffiths, published by O'Reilly Media Inc. This is a modified, hopefully improved, version of the original source provided electronically at https://github.com/dogriffiths/HeadFirstC

The aim of this project is to add more of the code included in the book, to fix errors and strange sorting methods found in the original, and most importantly to make every piece of code compilable. All comments not started with [ADDED COMMENT] are present in the book or electronic source.

When possible, code from exercises will be included and will be compilable and capable of running without error. They are included under the page with the solution and are included for demonstration and reinforcement of concepts, NOT so you can run or look at the code and know the solution.

This book is a fantastic introduction to programming in C and through this project I hope to help make it even more enjoyable.
