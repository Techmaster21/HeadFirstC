On page 374 it will say to use -I/includes
For us, since we did not place it in a folder called includes directly under the
root directory, and instead put it in the local directory, we will instead use 
-I./includes as previously.

Likewise on page 375, I recommend using the local libs directory provided in 
case you run into permission denied or other issues. The syntax will of course 
change into "gcc -shared hfcal.o -o ./libs/*" where the * is whatever the
library is to be called on your platform. If that syntax doesn't work on
Windows, try using Windows Powershell instead of cmd.exe, it's more UNIX syntax 
friendly

Also on that page, when compiling the elliptical program, the book suddenly 
starts using windows filesystem syntax with the backslash instead of forward 
slash. For some reason it seems to work on my linux system, but if for some 
reason it doesn't for you, just use the syntax we have been.
Also it should be -I\includes not -I\include

On page 376 if you're on linux you just need to add a . before the /libs if you 
put it in the local directory.
