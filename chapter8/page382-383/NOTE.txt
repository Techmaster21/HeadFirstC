gcc -c -fPIC -I./includes hfcal.c -o hfcal.o
gcc -shared hfcal.o -o ./libs/<whatever_it_should_be_called_for_your_os>
gcc treadmill.c -I./includes -L./libs -lhfcal -o treadmill

Be sure to set your path to point to ./libs for your OS then run

./treadmill

Notice it is giving American readouts.
Now run:

gcc -c -fPIC -I./includes hfcal_UK.c -o hfcal.o
gcc -shared hfcal.o -o ./libs/<whatever_you_used_before>
./treadmill

Notice it is now giving English readouts, without ever having to recompile the 
treadmill application!
