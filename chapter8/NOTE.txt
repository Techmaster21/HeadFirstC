In this chapter, in order to follow the instructions in the book, it is 
imperative that you have access to administrative rights on your system. As this 
is not guaranteed, I have worked on this chapter based on the assumption you do 
not, and will attempt to offer advice on how to proceed if you do not have such 
administrative rights. Even if you do have administrative rights, it may help 
to read this to know why I arranged or changed things the way I did.

Also note that you will have to recompile the encrypt.c and checksum.c into 
object files quite a few times (or copy them from the previous pages), as I 
cannot provide them for you.

-If you can do what the book asks, do. It makes it much easier. If you can't, 
read on:

General rule: Wherever it says '/' in front of a folder name, replace it with 
'./' to mean something in the "current directory"
Wherever I say to replace it with './' you can just remove the './' and it will 
work fine, it's just more clear to specify './'

Exceptions noted below:

page356
--Way 1 simply isn't possible without administrative privileges

page374-377
-page375
--It should be -I/includes for root directory folder "includes" same for -L/libs
Though the provided syntax seems to work if the folder is in the local 
directory, I recommend against it as it really isn't correct on Unix-like
systems.
